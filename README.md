# Git and GitHub Simple Guide

This guide is intended to give a working walkthrough of the flow of working with Git and GitHub to deliver output

## What is Git
Git is a decentralised Source Code Management (SCM) tool.  Let's break that down:
* **decentralised** - people can work independently and then bring their changes together
* **Source Code** - source code refers to the 'raw' materials used to deliver a product; this can include actual code files, documents, tests, scripts.  These need to be managed so the product works, as any old junk does not a good project make
* **Management** - tracking and managing changes to the source code is important to ensuring that a product remains in a working state, while allowing the product to evolve to add new features/capabilities.
* **tool** - management of the source code needs to be done in a coherent manner.  This needs to be able to be done regardless of the platform (laptop/workstation/OS X/Windows/Linux) so the tooling needs to be available and interoperable however people choose to work

Source code management is used to track:
* what has changed
* who changed it
* when did they change it
* why did they change it
..... sounds familiar, right?

## What is GitHub
GitHub is a platform used to host projects managed using Git; there are other tools such as GitLab that do the same; we use GitHub mostly because it's totally hosted (and thereby doesn't need us to worry about servers, etc), easy to use and was something the person who set [phuse-org](https://github.com/phuse-org) up was familiar with.
